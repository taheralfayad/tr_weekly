TR_Weekly is a hackday project created by Taher Alfayad, Evan Goldsmith, and Viggie Kontonotas. It is an application that takes in an audio file, 
transcribes it, and creates a formatted log of the transcript using OpenAI tools Whisper and ChatGPT. It's intention was to be used for our
weekly Techrangers meetings to record the notes instead of having a dedicated note taker.

To get started, clone this repository and make sure you have pip and Python3 installed.
Once cloned, install the requirements by running this command in the terminal:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

From there insert the TR Weekly audio file you want to transcribe, run the program, and admire the results!
